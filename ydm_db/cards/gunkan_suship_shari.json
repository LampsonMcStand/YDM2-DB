  "text": "Finally got to visit that harbor specializing in Gunkan Suships that I've been curious about for a while! The premium \"Shari\" here is limited to 2000 Suships a year, and uses specially developed smooth aged rice, giving it extra boldness not found anywhere else. The classy atmosphere made my heart sing, too. The Gunkan Suship served had a perfect balance of vinegar, nigiri, shine, and shape, demonstrating exquisite artisanship. The owner told me, \"We are introducing rich yet mellow scented EDO-FRONT red vinegar in the near future,\" which I'm really looking forward to. However, I was disappointed the surrounding seas were a little noisy... so, giving it 4 stars with hope for improvements in the future.",
