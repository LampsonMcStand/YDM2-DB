  "text": "Answer the following problem. Apply the appropriate effect, based on the answer. \n(Problem: Prove Fermat's Last Theorem!) \nAndrew Wiles tried to prove that the Theorem by  Pierre de Fermat states that given the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any n greater or equal 3, it is  impossible for a, b and c to all be integers.Unfortunately the proof is after 7 years and few Decades  with other mathematicians uncompleted. And even if you memorize the entire proof of Andrew Wiles and  others you must write down 100 pages and to be a specialist to read and understand it.So toss a coin if the result is right you gain 5000 LP if wrong you take 1000 damage.
