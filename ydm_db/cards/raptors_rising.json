Also when you Xyz Summon \"Raidraptor - Rise Falcon\", you can Summon it using a \"Raidraptor\" Xyz Monster on your field except for \"Raidraptor - Rise Falcon\".\nIn addition, the following effect can be used once per turn and twice per Duel. Remove 1 Xyz Material from 1 \"Raidraptor - Rise Falcon\" you control, and Set 1 \"Rank-Up-Magic\" Spell Card to your field from your Deck. Then, you can increase the Rank of that monster by 1 or 2. At the end of the turn you have used this Skill, return all Rank 4 Xyz Monsters on your field and/or Graveyard to the Extra Deck.",
