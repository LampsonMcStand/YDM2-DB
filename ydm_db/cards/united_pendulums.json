Then, negate both cards' effects until the end of the turn. The turn you activate this Skill, you can only Special Summon from your Extra Deck once, except for Pendulum Summons.\nThis Skill can only be used/applied if, at the start of the Duel, at least half of the cards in your Deck (excluding Extra Deck) are Pendulum Monsters with the same Type.",
