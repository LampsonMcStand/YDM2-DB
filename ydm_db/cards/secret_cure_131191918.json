Add the first monster you excavate to your hand, and return the other cards to your Deck.\nThen, return 1 card from your hand to the Deck, and increase both your and your opponent's Life Points by the ATK of the monster you have added to your hand.\nThis Skill can only be used if you begin the Duel with a Deck (excluding Extra Deck) that contains at least 7 \"Altergeist\" monsters, and the same amount of \"Altergeist\" Trap Cards. This Skill can only be used once per Duel.",
